Clock period = 6.2ns
Number of cycle to perform the operation = 1517 cycles
Execution time = 1517 * 6.2 = 9405.4ns
Area obtained = 9313.192030 (um2)
Performance parameter = area * number of cycles * clock period
                                      = 9313.192030*1517*6.2
                                      = 87594296.318962 ns*um2
